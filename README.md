## Overview

Welcome to CARMA, a monolithic repository (monorepo) powered by Nx, designed to streamline the development of reactive GIS applications. This repository leverages the Vite bundler to optimize the build process and improve developer experience with efficient tooling and clear project structures.

## Key Features

- **Nx Monorepo:** Utilizes Nx to facilitate better code sharing and tooling across multiple applications and libraries within the same repository.
- **Vite Bundler:** Employs Vite for fast and lean builds, enhancing development with rapid updates and optimized production builds.
- **GIS-Focused:** Tailored for developing GIS applications, integrating mapping technologies seamlessly with modern web technologies.
- **React Framework:** Built with React to create interactive UIs efficiently, making the application reactive and user-friendly.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS)
- npm

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cismet/carma.git
   cd carma
   ```

... to be continued

## Development Guidelines

... Setup guide to be determined

### Dev Environment:

... node 20 or later

### Commit Guidelines

Before committing, ensure that the following conditions are met:

if only project is affect run nx build before pushing.

`npx nx build my-project-name`

for the whole project run

`npx nx run-many -t test`

there might be a need to impor submodule to the project for all build to complete.

`git submodule update --init --recursive`

### Typescript configuration

carma is using Typescript 5.5 as of July 2024
the projects are not transpiled by TypeScript itself and does not emit js.

[`tsconfig`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/) settings exist primarily for DX.

vite build and [`vite-plugin-dts`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vite-plugin-dts) are taking care of the actual transpiling and typescript declaration.

#### For _new_ production level projects:

- `/tsconfig.strict.base.json` should be extending the local project `./tsconfig.json`.

- changes to [`compilerOptions`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#compilerOptions) on a per project basis should be avoided.

#### For _new_ playground level projects:

- `/tsconfig.strict.base.json` is recommended but not required.
- `/tsconfig.base.json` can be used with local changes as needed.

#### For _existing_ production level projects:

- `/tsconfig.legacy.base.json` as lowest level of existing strictness permitted.
- `/tsconfig.base.json` as optional intermediate step
- `/tsconfig.strict.base.json` should be adopted, if feasible, on a per project commit basis.

#### handling code imports

Manually imported/copied `.js` and `.jsx` files that don't have any meaningful type safety checks (ts-ified by lots of _any_) should stay as `.js` and `.jsx` and not be renamed to `.ts` and `.tsx` or flagged with `ts-ignore` before proper type safety is implemented.
All configurations should allow importing `.js`

#### Types

common custom carma types and type declarations for external libraries
are to be added to their respective `/types/*.d.ts`

... tbd

#### verbatim Module Syntax

types are enforced to be imported separately from the module.
e.g.:

```
import type { ReactNode } from "react";
import { useEffect } from "react";
```

not mixed in like

```
import React, { useEffect, ReactNode } from "react";
```
